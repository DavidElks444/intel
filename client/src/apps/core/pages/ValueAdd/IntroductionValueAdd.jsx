        <h3>Scope of dashboard</h3>
        <p>
          The Value Add Dashboard provides a transparent view of how UKGI delivers impact across government. It tracks key metrics that demonstrate our role in guidance, reporting, and support for managing fiscal risk and improving decision-making. Through these measures, the dashboard shows how we advise on contingent liabilities, enhance fiscal transparency, and embed best practice. It highlights outcomes such as risk reduction, improved data completeness, and strengthened departmental engagement, alongside examples of tangible savings and policy influence. By combining quantitative indicators with qualitative insights, the dashboard gives stakeholders a clear picture of the value UKGI creates for taxpayers and government partners.

        <h3>What is FinTAG (Financial Instruments and Transactions Advisory Group)?</h3>
        <p>
          UKGI’s FinTAG unit was formed after the Autumn 2024 Budget, evolving from the Contingent Liabilities Central Capability. It advises government on complex financial instruments—loans, equity investments, and guarantees—used to support growth and manage risk. FinTAG also produces an annual report on government financial assets for fiscal planning. The team combines corporate finance, credit risk, actuarial, and data expertise, working on projects like housing, infrastructure, and energy security. It is a growing unit, currently around 20–30 specialists.
